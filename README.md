App Team final project 2024.

I created this fully functional Shazam recreation using Swift, SwiftUI, and ShazamKit. This was my first "non-trivial" iOS project and I really enjoyed the experience of creating something functional. I learned a lot about working with the ShazamKit API, working with audio, coming up with creative solutions to problems, and TROUBLESHOOTING. Thanks to this youtube video for code for creating the Shazam logo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gI7cPtzGsHc
